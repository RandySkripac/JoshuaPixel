# JoshuaPixel

Similar to Bally, this is another game I plan on creating. Joshua Pixel a charcater I'm going to impliment in a pixilated futuristic world.

**The current state is how far I got after one day of working.**

To Run:

* Download RandySkripacRuby5.zip
* Extract all
* Run Oct14.exe

I have no home screen so just alt tab out and exit the game from the exterior.
In the future, I plan on implimenting the standard video game features (HUD, life, enemies, music) along with creative objectives like time manipulation, character development, and more.
